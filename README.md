# DataStructures
Repository To practice Data structure and algorithm problems

This repository is intended as a store of files for common data structures. I also intend to use it as a showcase for the problems that I have solved. They will be very simple problems commonly occuring in data structures.

Index is here. I will be adding to it as I solve more problems:
1. LinkedList
